          Hi, I am Artem Matiushenko or as most people know me - artemko,
          {` ${age} `} years old art photographer from a small village in
          Ukraine.
          <br />
          <br />
          For now, I have been doing photography for about 4 years and I am
          really enjoying that. Everything started with taking photos of
          flowers, insects, and food as usual. But when I was getting older my
          world vision was constantly updating. And it reflected on my art. I
          started to create different magical scenes and save the pictures of
          them using a camera.
          <br />
          <br />I create my artworks to bring some more positive and genuine
          emotions to the world and to show how beautiful it is. I try to share
          all my feelings, which I felt when I was creating a certain artwork
          with the audience. So, I want people to forget about all the bad
          things in their life and dive into my magic world.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>Join me in this incredible journey!âœ¨</span>
